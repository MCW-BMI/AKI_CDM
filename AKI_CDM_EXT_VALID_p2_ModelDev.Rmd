### Aim 2: Model Development using data at KUMC

* Experiment #1: How accurately can we predict AKI 1 to 3 days before its onset? (Figure 1a)

* Experiment #2: How accurately can we predict at admission if AKI will occur in next 1 to 3 days? (Figure 1b)

* Experiment #3: How accurately can we predict if a patient will develop AKI within the next day? (Figure 1c)
