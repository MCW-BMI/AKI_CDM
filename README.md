## Background

Acute Kidney Injury (**AKI**) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of the intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In this application, we propose to build predictive models to identify patients at risk for hospital-acquired AKI and externally validate the models using the PCORnet (Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network)13 common data model (CDM) infrastructure. The project will be carried out with the following aims:

* **Aim 1**: Building predictive models on single-site data. We will develop and internally cross-validate machine learning based predictive models for in-hospital AKI using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the University of Kansas Medical Centerâ€™s (KUMC) PCORnet CDM. As co-I of the PCORnet network Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC), PI of this project has direct access to the KUMC CDM for model development.
 
* **Aim 2**: Validating predictive models on multi-site data. We will implement an automated analytic package with built in data extraction and predictive modeling from Aim 1 for distributed execution within two PCORnet clinical data research networks (CDRNs), namely GPC led by Dr. Waitman and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) site led by Dr. Matheny in pSCANNER (letters attached). All prototyping will be done on the KUMC CDM.

## Site Usage
In order for sites to extract AKI cohort, run predictive models and generate final report, [R Program] is required and [R studio] is preferred to be installed as well for convenient report generation. Valid channel should also be established between R and DBMS so that communication between R and CDM database can be supported. 

[R Program]: https://www.r-project.org/
[R studio]: https://www.rstudio.com/

1. Get `AKI_CDM` code
  - **download** the [AKI_CDM] repository as a .zip file, unzip and save folder as `AKI_CDM`    
  *OR*  
  - **clone** [AKI_CDM] repository (using [git command]):   
      i) navigate to the location `<local repo>` where you want to save the repository locally and type command line: `cd <local repo>`     
      ii) clone the AKI_CDM repository by typing command line: `git clone https://github.com/kumc-bmi/AKI_CDM`     


2. Prepare configeration file `config.csv` and save alongside the AKI_CDM project folder    
      i) download the empty `config_template.csv` file    
      ii) fill in the content accordingly (or you can manually create the file using the following format)
    
    |username     |password    |access         |cdm_db_schema     |cdm_db_server         |oracle_temp_schema                            |   
    |:------------|:-----------|:--------------|:-----------------|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------|    
    |your_username|your_passwd |//host:port/sid|current CDM schema|sid where CDM is saved|schema where intermediate tables will be saved|   
    
      iii) save as `config.csv` under the parent directory of AKI_CDM (so it would be at the same level as the AKI_CDM folder)

3. Extract AKI cohort and generate final report   
      i) **setup** working directory    
        - In *r-studio* environment, simply **open** R project `AKI_CDM.Rproj` within the folder
        *OR*    
        - In *plain r* environment, **set working directory** to where `AKI_CDM` locates by runing `setwd("/path/to/AKI_CDM")`
      
      ii) **run** r script `render_report.R`      
      
      iii) **collect** output files from `\output` folder   
        - 1. AKI_CDM_EXT_VALID_p1_QA.html - html report with description, figures and partial tables    
        - 2. AKI_CDM_EXT_VALID_p1_QA_TBL.xlsx - excel with full summary tables
